# Changelog

All notable changes to Mirasonic are documented here.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added

- Optional weekly discovery agent (`--profile agent`): syncs listening
  history to ListenBrainz, requests recommendations and fresh releases, and
  builds a `Discoveries` playlist from tracks it can match on YouTube Music.
  Off by default; the playback server never imports it or needs its
  credentials.
- Local, network-free library ranking (`music_agent.py rankings`) by play
  frequency, recency, and starred status.
- Real `scrobble.view` handling: playing-now pings from clients that never
  send `submission=true` (Amperfy included) now credit a listen.

### Fixed

- Scrobbles synced to ListenBrainz hourly instead of only once a completed
  discovery week rolled over, which had delayed a Monday-afternoon listen by
  up to two weeks before it could affect recommendations.
- The agent now logs at INFO level, so a successful run leaves a trace
  instead of looking identical to a container that never started.

### Known limitations

- Other Subsonic clients have not been verified yet.
- Age-restricted tracks cannot be resolved anonymously.
- There is no multi-user support, transcoding, lyrics, podcasts, or radio.
- YouTube internal interfaces can change without notice and temporarily break playback.
